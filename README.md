# Pomodoro Timer

A timer to help you with your your focus.

I was inspired by Lofi Girl's pomodoro Timer stream and created this website.

There is a feature in that stream that when 2 cycles complete (2 break timers and 2 work timers), it gives you a 15 minute break. I did not implement that but it is still good in its own way.

You can play your own songs over it and still use my pomodoro timer which is a plus that you don't see Lofi Girl's stream.

You can keep this timer beside your screen whil you work using the PWA version of tis website. Hope you like it!
