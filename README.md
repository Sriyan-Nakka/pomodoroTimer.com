# Pomodoro Timer

A timer to help you with your your focus.

I was inspired by Lofi Girl's pomodoro Timer stream and created this website.

There is a feature in that stream that when 2 cycles complete (2 break timers and 2 work timers), it gives you a 15 minute break. I did not implement that but this is is still good in its own way.

You can play your own songs over it and still use my pomodoro timer which is a plus that you don't see in Lofi Girl's stream, but the lofi that plays during the livestream is still perfect for work and I definately do recommend it.

You can use this timer offline and beside your screen while you work using the PWA version of this website. Hope you like it!

## Updates:

#### Update 1.5
Update 1.5 is just the implementation of offline usability for the PWA and Website version(Website version is not tested yet, I recommend PWA more) as the PWA was only working when you were online.
